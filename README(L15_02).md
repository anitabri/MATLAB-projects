# Turtle Graphics Board Simulation (L15_Q02) – MATLAB

This program simulates a basic "turtle graphics"-style game on a 20x20 board. The turtle can turn, move, and leave a trail.

## How It Works
- Begins with the turtle at the center of a 20x20 grid.
- User inputs commands to:
  - Turn right: 1
  - Turn left: 2
  - Move forward: 3
  - Print the board: 4
  - Quit: 5
- Movement direction and board updates after each command.

## Key Concepts
- Matrix manipulation
- Command-driven logic
- Direction tracking

## How to Run
Open `L15_Q02.m` in MATLAB and run the script. Enter a number from 1–5 as prompted to change the position of the turtle.
