## Projects

### 1. Number Game – `L13_Q04.m`

A user vs. computer game. Players take turns selecting numbers, and the computer collects factors of the player’s choice.

* **Skills:** Input validation, control flow, array handling
* **Run:** Open `L13_Q04.m` and respond to the prompts

---

### 2. Adaptive Quadrature – `L15_Q01.m`

Implements a recursive adaptive trapezoidal rule to approximate the integral of `cos(x)` with precision.

* **Skills:** Numerical integration, recursion, error estimation
* **Run:** Open `L15_Q01.m` and respond to the prompts

---

### 3. Turtle Graphics Board Simulation – `L15_Q02.m`

A command-driven simulation where a turtle moves around a 20x20 grid, turning and drawing paths.

* **Skills:** Matrix manipulation, control logic, user interaction
* **Run:** Open `L15_Q02.m` and enter commands (1–5) when prompted

---

### 4. Monte Carlo Integration of cos(x) – `L11_Q04.m`

This project uses random sampling to estimate the integral of `cos(x)` by simulating points under the curve and calculating hit and miss ratios.

* **What it does:** Randomly samples points under the curve to approximate area
* **Why it matters:** Demonstrates probabilistic reasoning and data-driven approximation
* **Run:** Open `L11_Q04.m`, enter the number of trials, and view the estimated result

---

### 5. Gaussian Sample Histogram – `L11_Q05.m`

This program simulates 10,000 samples from a normal distribution using the Box-Muller transform and bins them into a histogram.

* **What it does:** Simulates normally distributed data to explore distribution patterns
* **Why it matters:** Mimics basic data analysis: generating, classifying, and counting data
* **Run:** Open `L11_Q05.m` and follow the input prompts
