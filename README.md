## Projects

### 1. Number Game – L13_Q04.m
A  user vs. computer game. Players take turns selecting numbers, and the computer collects instructions of the player’s choice.
- **Skills:** Input validation, control flow, array handling
- **Run:** Open `L13_Q04.m` and respond the prompts

### 2. Adaptive Quadrature – `L15_Q01.m`
Implements a recursive adaptive trapezoidal rule to approximate the integral of `cos(x)` with precision.
- **Skills:** Numerical integration, recursion, error estimation
- **Run:** Open `L15_Q01.m` and respond to the prompts

### 3. Turtle Graphics Board Simulation – `L15_Q02.m`
A command-driven simulation where a turtle moves around a 20x20 grid, turning and drawing paths.
- **Skills:** Matrix manipulation, control logic, user interaction
- **Run:** Open `L15_Q02.m` and enter commands (1–5) when prompted
